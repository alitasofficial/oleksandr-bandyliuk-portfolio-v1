## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command        | Action                                       |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------- |

| `pnpm dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`  |
| `pnpm build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `pnpm preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |

## How to add new blog post

To add a new blog post, you need to create a new markdown or mdx file in the `src/content/blog/` directory with relevant frontmatter.

Here is a sample of the frontmatter:
** Tags are case sensitive

```markdown
---
title: "Title of the blog post"
description: "Description of the blog post"
pubDate: "2022-01-01"
heroImage: "image.jpg"
tags: ["Tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

## SEO

The SEO component is located in the `src/layouts/Layout.astro` file. The component is used in the layout files to set the SEO meta tags.

## Assets

The assets are located in the `public/` or `src/assets` directory. You can add images, fonts, or any other static files in this directory.

All image files are optimized using the `sharp` package for better performance.
